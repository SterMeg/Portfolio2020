    <h2>About Meghan</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a full-stack developer who is passionate about creative
      problem-solving and asking questions. I read and write documentation with
      enthusiasm, and am always ready to learn something new. I am fascinated by
      the logical process of programming regardless of framework or language. I
      love puzzles and coming up with creative solutions to problems, so I face
      challenging work with drive and excitement. I have a background in English
      Literature, which has given me an eye for syntax and the ability to
      perform self-directed research when encountering unfamiliar code.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not coding, I enjoy practicing circus arts, reading and talking
      about comics, playing board games, and hanging out with my two dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm currently on a mission to reduce my emissions by replacing my car with
      an e-bike, and am looking for remote opportunities so that I can achieve
      that goal.
